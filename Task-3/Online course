I had completed Task-3 (Design A Landing Page On Any Genre Using Either Figma Or Adobe XD) through Figma.
I took the topic of "Cricket Academy"  named "NATRAJ Cricket Academy".
In Figma, I took the desktop-sized layout and then I have attached the background.
I have made my own logo and attatched a picture I searched through google.
I had used rectangular frameworks for highlighting the options and I gave color to that .
